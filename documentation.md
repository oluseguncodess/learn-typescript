# TypeScript
TypeScript is all about Type Safety in Javascript! It includes static type checking which is associating types with variables, functions, etc so errors can be caught instantly at compile-time rather than at run-time 

TypeScript is a development tool because it kind of still converts to javascript before your program runs. It just helps you write better javascript code.

## Differences between Javascript and TypeScript
In Javascript, it's possible to reassign a variable with a different data type but that isn't allowed in typescript.

## TypeScript Syntax 
When declaring a variable, you have to include the date type - `let variableName : type = variable`
