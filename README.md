# TypeScript Learning Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn TypeScript.

## About TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, which can catch common errors and improve your productivity through tooling and IDE support.

## Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of TypeScript syntax and features.
- Build practical projects to apply my knowledge.
- Explore TypeScript's advanced features like generics, decorators, and more.

## Progress
- [ ] Basic Syntax
